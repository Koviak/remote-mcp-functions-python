# Token Management
token_storage:
  type: "redis"  # or "memory" for testing
  redis_url: "${REDIS_URL:-redis://localhost:6379}"
  cache_ttl: 3600  # 1 hour

# Security Notes
security:
  - "ROPC is less secure - consider certificate auth for production"
  - "Store credentials securely (use Key Vault in production)"
  - "Enable MFA exemption for service accounts if needed"
  - "Monitor authentication failures"

# Testing
test_commands:
  - "python test_agent_auth.py"
  - "func start --port 7071"
