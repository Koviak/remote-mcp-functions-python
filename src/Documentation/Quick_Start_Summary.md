# Quick Start Summary - MS Graph Integration

## 🚀 Complete Setup in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Start Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start ngrok (if not already running)
ngrok http 7071 --domain=agency-swarm.ngrok.app

# Terminal 2 - Start Function App (from src directory!)
cd src
func start
```

### Step 2: Create/Update Webhook Subscriptions
```bash
cd src
python setup_local_webhooks.py
```

### Step 3: Test Task Creation
```python
import requests

# Create a task via API
task = {
    "title": "My First Agent Task",
    "planId": "CbfN3rLYAkS0ZutzQP5J9mUAFxxt"  # Your plan ID
}

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:7071/api/agent/tasks",
    json=task
)

print(response.json())
```

## 🔑 Important Information

- **Annika's User ID**: `5ac3e02f-825f-49f1-a2e2-8fe619020b60`
- **Webhook URL**: `https://agency-swarm.ngrok.app/api/graph_webhook`
- **Redis Tasks**: `annika:tasks:{id}` (primary storage)
- **Pub/Sub Channel**: `annika:tasks:updates`

## 🎯 What's Working

✅ Webhook endpoint receiving Graph notifications
✅ Task creation API for agents
✅ **NEW: Enhanced sync service with immediate uploads**
✅ Redis-first architecture (microsecond operations)
✅ Event-driven uploads to Planner (instant)
✅ Polling downloads from Planner (30 seconds)
✅ Real-time notifications via Redis pub/sub

## 📊 Data Flow (Enhanced Architecture)

```
Agent → Redis → Other Agents (instant)
         ↓
    Event-driven → Sync Service → MS Planner (immediate upload)
                        ↓
                   Polling → Downloads from Planner (30s)
```

**Key Change**: Agents now work at Redis speed (0.1ms) while sync happens in background!

## 🆘 Common Issues

**Function App won't start?**
- Must run from `src` directory
- Check port 7071 is free
- Ensure Redis is running

**Tasks not syncing?**
- Verify plan ID is correct
- Check Annika has access to the plan
- Monitor Function App logs

**Webhook not responding?**
- Ensure ngrok is running
- Check domain matches: `agency-swarm.ngrok.app`
- Verify Function App is running

## 💡 Next Actions

1. Test email notifications by sending to Annika@reddypros.com
2. Create calendar events and watch for notifications
3. Create tasks via the agent API and verify they appear in Planner
4. Subscribe to Redis channels for real-time updates

Everything is ready for your autonomous agents! 🎉
