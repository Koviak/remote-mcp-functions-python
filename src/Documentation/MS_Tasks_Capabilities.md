Users can manage their own user account, and administrators can manage user accounts for their organization on behalf of the user or via an app with its own identity.

The following list describes some of the tasks you can perform with users in your organization through Microsoft Graph:

    Core user management tasks
        Add or delete users
        Reset a user's password
        Upload or retrieve a photo for a user
        Determine their reporting structure or assign managers
        Manage the user's authentication methods
        Grant users administrative roles in your organization
        Assign or remove licenses to users
        Track changes to users in your organization
    Mail management
        List mails and send new mail
        Create and list user contacts and organize contacts in folders
        Retrieve and update mailbox folders and settings
    Calendar management
        Manage or list events on a user's calendar
        Manage a user's calendar and calendar groups
        View tasks assigned to a user
        Find free meeting times for a set of users
        Get a list of reminders set on a user's calendar
    File management
        Access a user's files and folders in OneDrive
    Group management tasks
        Add users to groups dynamically by matching specific attributes, for example, their department, or statically on demand; list a user's group memberships and determine whether a user is a member of a group
    Application management tasks
        Assign or remove applications and their associated roles for users
    Enrich your app with user insights - maximize relevance in your application by promoting recently used or trending documents and contacts associated with a user.
        Return documents recently viewed and modified by a user.
        Return documents and sites trending around a user's activity.
        List documents shared with a user through email or OneDrive for Business.




## Summary

I've successfully implemented Redis-based token storage for delegated access tokens in your MCP Functions server! Here's what's working:

### ‚úÖ What's Implemented and Working:

1. **Redis Token Storage** (`mcp_redis_config.py`)
   - Connects to Redis using all your environment variables
   - Stores tokens with automatic TTL based on expiration
   - Tracks active tokens for monitoring

2. **Enhanced Authentication Manager** (`agent_auth_manager.py`)
   - Now uses RedisTokenManager for persistent storage
   - Successfully acquires real JWT tokens from Microsoft Graph
   - Stores tokens in Redis automatically
   - Falls back to memory-only caching if Redis fails

3. **Token Refresh Service** (`token_refresh_service.py`)
   - Background service that monitors tokens
   - Refreshes tokens before they expire (15-minute buffer)
   - Runs every 5 minutes by default

4. **Token API Endpoints** (`token_api_endpoints.py`)
   - `/api/tokens` - **Working!** Lists all active tokens
   - `/api/tokens/{scope}` - Get specific token (has routing issues)
   - `/api/tokens/health` - Health check (has routing issues)
   - `/api/tokens/refresh/{scope}` - Manual refresh

### üìä Current Status:

```json
{
    "count": 1,
    "tokens": [{
        "expires_on": 1749076735,
        "scope": "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default",
        "stored_at": 1749071523,
        "refresh_count": 0,
        "metadata": {
            "acquired_by": "agent_auth_manager",
            "client_id": "fd79a94d-f572-4439-bba2-6465e0c40122"
        },
        "key": "annika:tokens:agent:https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"
    }]
}
```

### üîë Key Features Working:

1. **Real JWT tokens** are being acquired from Microsoft Graph using agent credentials
2. **Tokens are stored in Redis** with proper TTL management
3. **Token listing API** is functional at `/api/tokens`
4. **Automatic token refresh** service is operational
5. **Other applications can access tokens** via:
   - HTTP API at `http://localhost:7071/api/tokens`
   - Direct Redis access using keys like `annika:tokens:agent:{scope}`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues:

Some route parameters endpoints (`/api/tokens/{scope}` and `/api/tokens/health`) are returning 404 errors, likely due to Azure Functions routing configuration issues. However, the core functionality is working - tokens are being stored and can be retrieved.

### üöÄ Next Steps:

Other applications can now:
1. Call `GET http://localhost:7071/api/tokens` to list available tokens
2. Connect directly to Redis and get tokens using keys like `annika:tokens:agent:https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`
3. The tokens will be automatically refreshed before they expire

The Redis token storage system is operational and keeping your delegated access tokens fresh for use by other applications!
