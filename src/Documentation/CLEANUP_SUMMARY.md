# Cleanup Summary - Redis-First Architecture

## üóëÔ∏è Files Removed

1. **`planner_polling_service.py`** 
   - Replaced by the enhanced `planner_sync_service.py`
   - Old service only did polling, new service does bidirectional sync

2. **`Documentation/MS_Graph_Webhook_Integration.md`**
   - Replaced by `MS_Graph_Webhook_Integration_COMPLETE.md`
   - Old documentation was incomplete

## üìù Files Updated

### Code Files:
1. **`http_endpoints.py`**
   - Removed queue-based approach (`rpush` to queue)
   - Now stores tasks directly in Redis (`set` with key pattern)
   - Updated response message from "queued" to "created"

2. **`test_agent_task_creation.py`**
   - Removed queue operations (`rpush`, `llen`)
   - Now stores tasks directly with expiry

3. **`function_app.py`**
   - Already updated to use new sync service

### Documentation Files:
1. **`MS_Graph_Webhook_Integration_COMPLETE.md`**
   - Updated reference from polling service to sync service

2. **`Quick_Start_Summary.md`**
   - Changed from "Redis Queue" to "Redis Tasks" pattern

3. **`Planner_Agent_Task_Creation_Guide.md`**
   - Removed all queue references
   - Updated to show direct Redis storage pattern
   - Changed monitoring commands from queue operations to key patterns

## üîÑ Architecture Changes Reflected

### Old Pattern (Removed):
```python
# Queue-based approach
redis_client.rpush("annika:tasks:queue", task_json)
redis_client.llen("annika:tasks:queue")
```

### New Pattern (Implemented):
```python
# Direct storage with expiry
redis_client.set(f"annika:tasks:{task_id}", task_json, ex=86400)
redis_client.publish("annika:tasks:updates", event_json)
```

## ‚úÖ Result

The codebase now consistently uses the Redis-first architecture where:
- Agents work directly with Redis keys (not queues)
- Tasks are stored with expiration
- Events trigger immediate sync
- No references to the old polling-only approach remain

All obsolete files have been removed and documentation has been updated to reflect the enhanced architecture. 

## üßπ Final Cleanup (Latest)

### Additional Files Removed:

1. **Duplicate Test Files in `src/Tests/`**:
   - `test_cache_population.py`
   - `test_cache_quick.py`
   - `test_cache_functionality.py`
   - `test_agent_task_creation.py`
   - These were duplicates of files already deleted from `src/`

2. **Outdated Documentation**:
   - `CACHE_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Referenced deleted test files
   - `CACHE_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Results from deleted test files
   - `CACHING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Referenced old test files

3. **One-time Utility Scripts**:
   - `get_user_id.py` - No longer needed after obtaining user ID

## ‚úÖ Final Result

The codebase is now fully cleaned up with:
- No duplicate or outdated test files
- No obsolete documentation
- No temporary utility scripts
- All code and documentation aligned with Redis-first architecture
- GraphMetadataManager fully integrated with 24-hour TTL for metadata
- Tasks stored with no expiry as requested
