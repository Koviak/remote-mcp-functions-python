# ngrok PATH Fix - Problem Solved! âœ…

## The Issue
Even though ngrok was installed and added to PATH, Windows wasn't recognizing the `ngrok` command in new terminals.

## The Solution
We've implemented THREE fixes:

### 1. âœ… PowerShell Profile (Permanent Fix)
Added ngrok to your PowerShell profile so it loads automatically in every new PowerShell session.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Effect**: All future PowerShell windows will have ngrok available

### 2. âœ… Quick Session Fix (ngrok-alias.ps1)
For any terminal where ngrok isn't working, just run:
```powershell
. .\ngrok-alias.ps1
```
This immediately adds ngrok to that terminal session.

### 3. âœ… Full PATH in User Environment
ngrok is permanently in your user PATH at `C:\Tools\ngrok`

## How to Use ngrok Now

### In Current Terminal
ngrok is ready to use! Just run:
```bash
ngrok http --domain=agency-swarm.ngrok.app 7071
```

### In New Terminals
After closing ALL PowerShell/Terminal windows and reopening:
```bash
ngrok http --domain=agency-swarm.ngrok.app 7071
```

### If ngrok Still Not Found in a Terminal
Run the quick fix:
```bash
. C:\Users\JoshuaKoviak\OneDrive - Koviak Built\Documents\GitHub\remote-mcp-functions-python\ngrok-alias.ps1
```

## Why This Happened
Windows can be stubborn about PATH updates. Common causes:
- Terminal apps cache environment variables
- Multiple terminal tabs/windows need full restart
- Windows sometimes requires logout/login for PATH changes
- You had another ngrok from WinGet that might have interfered

## Your ngrok Setup
- **Installation**: C:\Tools\ngrok\ngrok.exe
- **Auth Token**: Already configured
- **PowerShell Profile**: Updated to include ngrok
- **Current Status**: âœ… Working!

## Files Created
- `ngrok-alias.ps1` - Quick fix for any session
- `Add-Ngrok-To-Profile.ps1` - Adds ngrok to PowerShell profile
- `install_ngrok.ps1` - Original installer
- `add_ngrok_to_user_path.ps1` - PATH updater

Everything is working now! ðŸŽ‰
