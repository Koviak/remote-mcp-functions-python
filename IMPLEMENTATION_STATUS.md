# Implementation Status - Delegated Access (OBO) and App Access

## Current Status - UPDATED

The implementation has been updated to address the identified issues:

### ✅ Successfully Implemented

1. **Dependencies**: `azure-identity` package is correctly added to `requirements.txt`
2. **Configuration**: All required settings are present in `local.settings.json`:
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
   - `DOWNSTREAM_API_SCOPE`
3. **Authentication Level**: Function app uses `func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS` for built-in auth
4. **OBO Pattern**: The code demonstrates the OBO pattern with `OnBehalfOfCredential`
5. **Documentation**: README.md has been updated with delegated access information

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Environment Variable Consistency**: 
   - All modules now use consistent variable names: `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - Fixed in both `additional_tools.py` and `http_endpoints.py`

2. **Registered Functions**: 
   - `register_additional_tools()` is now called in `function_app.py`
   - `register_http_endpoints()` is now called in `function_app.py`
   - All MCP tools and HTTP endpoints are now properly registered

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added comprehensive module docstring to `function_app.py` explaining authentication approaches
   - Updated README.md to clearly explain the MCP trigger limitation
   - Clear separation between MCP tools (app-only) and HTTP endpoints (can use OBO)

### ⚠️ Architectural Limitations (Cannot be Fixed)

1. **MCP Trigger Limitation**: 
   - MCP tool triggers cannot access HTTP request headers
   - The `X-MS-TOKEN-AAD-ACCESS-TOKEN` header from built-in auth is not accessible
   - This makes true OBO flow impossible with MCP triggers
   - This is a fundamental limitation of the MCP trigger binding architecture

## Authentication Configuration

### For MCP Tools (App-Only Authentication)
Configure these environment variables:
```
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-app-id>
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-app-secret>
AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
```

### For HTTP Endpoints (Delegated Access)
Additionally configure:
```
DOWNSTREAM_API_SCOPE=<scope-for-downstream-api>
```
And enable built-in authentication in Azure App Service.

## Current Architecture

1. **MCP Tools** (`additional_tools.py`):
   - Use app-only authentication with `ClientSecretCredential`
   - Work with application permissions
   - 9 tools registered for Teams, Files, Sites, and Security operations

2. **HTTP Endpoints** (`http_endpoints.py`):
   - Use app-only authentication by default
   - Can be modified to use OBO for delegated access
   - 34 HTTP endpoints registered for comprehensive Microsoft Graph operations

3. **Core Functions** (`function_app.py`):
   - Demonstrates both authentication patterns
   - `_acquire_downstream_token()` shows OBO pattern (for HTTP triggers only)
   - Basic MCP tools for snippet management

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   cd src
   func start
   ```

2. **Deploy to Azure**:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

3. **Configure Azure AD**:
   - Register an app in Azure AD
   - Grant appropriate Microsoft Graph permissions
   - Configure the environment variables

## Summary

The implementation now properly supports:
- ✅ App-only authentication for all MCP tools
- ✅ HTTP endpoints that can use either authentication method
- ✅ Clear documentation of limitations and capabilities
- ✅ Consistent configuration across all modules

The architectural limitation of MCP triggers not supporting delegated access remains, but the implementation provides a clear path for using app-only authentication with MCP tools and delegated access with HTTP endpoints.
