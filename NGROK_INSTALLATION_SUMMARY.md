## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Failed to add to system PATH"
- This is normal - system PATH requires admin privileges
- User PATH was successfully updated (no admin needed)
- Just restart your terminal

### "ngrok not found" after restart
- The user PATH update should persist
- If not, manually add `C:\Tools\ngrok` to your PATH in System Settings

### Domain errors
- Make sure you're using the exact domain: `agency-swarm.ngrok.app`
- This is a reserved domain that should work with your account
